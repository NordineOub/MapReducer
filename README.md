# Yarn Lab 2                                           

This mapreduce jar file allows you to do several operations:

- Count the number of words
  - See districts containing trees
  - See all tree species in Paris
  - Count the number of trees per species
  - The maximum height per type of tree
  - Sort the height of trees from smallest to largest
  - Show district with most trees
 
Here's how to apply each of these operations

## How to apply the wordcount : 

```s
yarn jar hadoop-examples-mapreduce-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar wordcount /user/username/raw/book.txt  /user/username/wordcount
```
##  Districts containing trees 



```s
yarn jar hadoop-examples-mapreduce-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar districtswithtrees /user/username/raw/book.txt  /user/username/districtswithtrees
```
## All tree species


```s

```
## Number of trees by species

```s
```
## Maximum height per tree type

```s
```

## Sort tree height

```s
```
## District with most trees

```s
```
